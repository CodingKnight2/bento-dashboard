# Issue 12: Missing error boundary
gh issue create \
  --title "feat: Add error boundary for widget failures" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem Description
When a widget fails to render (e.g., due to API errors or unexpected data), the entire dashboard can crash. An error boundary would prevent this.

## Context
React Error Boundaries catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Modify a widget to throw an error
2. Observe that the entire dashboard may become unusable
3. No graceful error handling is shown

## Expected Behavior
- If a single widget fails, it should show an error state
- Other widgets should continue to function
- User should be able to retry or remove the failed widget

## Actual Behavior
Widget errors may cause the entire application to crash or show a blank screen.

## Files to Investigate
- `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Wrap widgets in error boundary
- Create new `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` component

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ErrorBoundary component created
- [ ] Each widget wrapped in ErrorBoundary
- [ ] Failed widgets show error message with retry option
- [ ] Other widgets continue to work when one fails

# Issue 13: Race condition in weather fetching
gh issue create \
  --title "fix: Handle race condition when searching locations rapidly" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem Description
When a user rapidly searches for different locations in the WeatherWidget, race conditions can occur where an older request's response overwrites a newer one.

## Context
This is a common async issue where multiple concurrent requests can return in any order. The last request to complete should be the one displayed.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open WeatherWidget
2. Quickly type and search for multiple different cities
3. Observe that weather may show results from a previous search

## Expected Behavior
Only the most recent search request should update the weather display. Previous requests should be cancelled or ignored.

## Actual Behavior
Race conditions can cause stale data to be displayed if older requests complete after newer ones.

## Files to Investigate
- `src/components/widgets/WeatherWidget.tsx` - fetchWeather function
- Consider using AbortController or request cancellation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Race condition is prevented using AbortController or similar
- [ ] Only latest request results are displayed

setInterval is not guaranteed to execute at exact intervals, especially when the browser tab is inactive. Using requestAnimationFrame or the Performance API provides better accuracy.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start Pomodoro timer
2. Switch to another browser tab for 25 minutes
3. Return and observe timer may be inaccurate

## Expected Behavior
Timer should maintain reasonable accuracy even when:
- Tab is inactive
- Computer is under heavy load
- User returns after extended time

## Actual Behavior
Timer may drift significantly when tab is inactive due to browser throttling of setInterval.

## Files to Investigate
- `src/components/widgets/PomodoroWidget.tsx` - interval logic
- Consider using Date-based timing or requestAnimationFrame

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Timer accuracy improved using Date comparison
- [ ] Handles tab visibility changes correctly

  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem Description
When multiple tasks have the same due date or no due date, the sorting is inconsistent and may not follow the expected priority order.

## Context
Tasks should be sorted by: completion status, then priority, then due date. When dates are equal, secondary sort criteria should apply.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create multiple tasks with the same due date
2. Observe that sorting between them may be inconsistent
3. Create tasks without due dates
4. Notice sorting may vary between renders

## Expected Behavior
Tasks should always have a consistent sort order:
